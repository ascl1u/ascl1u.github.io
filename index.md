Hi! I'm [Will Brown](https://x.com/willccbb).<br><br>

I'm a Research Lead at [Prime Intellect](https://www.primeintellect.ai/), where I work on open-source research and infrastructure for agentic reinforcement learning, including the [verifiers](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers) library and the [Environments Hub](https://app.primeintellect.ai/dashboard/environments).<br><br> 

Previously, I was a member of Morgan Stanley's [Machine Learning Research](https://www.morganstanley.com/about-us/technology/machine-learning-research-papers) group, where I worked on a variety of projects related to LLMs. I completed my PhD (CS) at Columbia, where I was fortunate to be co-advised by [Christos Papadimitriou](https://www.engineering.columbia.edu/faculty/christos-papadimitriou) and [Tim Roughgarden](https://timroughgarden.org/). Before that, I studied computer science, data science, and philosophy student at Penn, and I've spent time in research and engineering roles at AWS, Two Sigma, MongoDB, and AmFam.<br><br>
