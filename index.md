Hi, I'm [Andy Liu](https://x.com/lscqtds).<br><br>

I'm an independent engineer recently graduated from UCSD, contributing to open source projects and interested in physical AI.<br><br>

Previously, I have interned at Amazon, working on [Learn](https://learn.amazon.com/) infrastructure, and at Bambu Lab, working on the defect detection system.<br><br>
